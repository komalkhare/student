# Personalized Student Recommendations for NEET Testline

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze student performance on NEET Testline quizzes and provide personalized recommendations to help them improve their preparation. It leverages data from the NEET Testline app (or simulated data if actual API access is restricted) to identify weak areas, improvement trends, and performance gaps for individual students. Based on these insights, it generates tailored recommendations for further practice and learning.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes two main data sources:

- **Current Quiz Data:** This includes details of the user's latest quiz submission, such as questions answered, topics covered, and responses given.
- **Historical Quiz Data:** This comprises performance data from the last 5 quizzes for each user, including scores and response maps.

## Approach

The project employs the following approach:

1. **Data Loading:** Data from the API endpoints (or simulated data) is loaded and preprocessed.
2. **Performance Analysis:** The student's performance is analyzed based on factors like topic accuracy, difficulty level performance, and overall quiz scores.
3. **Insight Generation:** Weak areas, performance gaps, and potential improvement trends are identified.
4. **Persona Analysis:** Based on performance patterns, student personas are assigned to provide a more personalized understanding of strengths and weaknesses.
5. **Recommendation Generation:** Actionable recommendations are generated, such as suggesting specific topics to review, difficulty levels to practice, and resources for further learning.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install them:2. **API Endpoints (if applicable):** If you have access to the NEET Testline API, replace the placeholder API endpoints in the `main()` function with the actual endpoints.

3. **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script (`student_recommendations.py`) to analyze the data and generate recommendations.

## Usage

1. **Input Data:** The script expects data in the format provided by the NEET Testline API (or simulated data with a similar structure).
2. **Output:** The script will print the generated insights and recommendations to the console.

## Features

- **Weak Area Identification:** Pinpoints topics where the student is struggling.
- **Performance Gap Analysis:** Identifies difficulty levels that pose challenges.
- **Improvement Trend Detection:** Tracks progress and identifies areas of improvement.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides tailored suggestions for further practice.
- **Student Persona Analysis:** Assigns personas to provide a deeper understanding of the student's learning style.

## Future Enhancements

- **More Diverse Personas:** Expand the persona analysis to include more criteria and create a wider range of student profiles.
- **Resource Recommendations:** Integrate with external resources (e.g., Khan Academy, BYJU'S) to provide targeted learning materials.
- **Visualizations:** Create interactive visualizations to present insights and recommendations in a more engaging manner.
